Problem Details
===============

A major commercial insurance company (InsureCo) insures a number of companies 
against property damage from adverse events. The companies and the type and 
location of the covered events are listed in deals.csv. To limit their exposure 
to potential losses, they decide to buy a reinsurance contract, covering them 
in case of certain large events. The contract, described in contract.json, covers 
all events in the USA and Canada, excluding tornados, up to a maximum amount of 
$3,000 on any one event. Find the deals covered by the reinsurance contract, 
filtering deals.csv using the coverage details in contract.json.

The output should be something like:

 DealId     Company       Peril Location
      1        WestCoastOil  Earthquake      USA
      2        WestCoastOil   Hailstone   Canada
      5  GeorgiaUniversity   Hurricane      USA

When modelling the risk on this reinsurance contract at InsureCo we run a 
simulation to model expected losses to the underlying insurance deals. In the 
scenario described in losses.csv, where a number of events occur, how much could 
InsureCo claim on the reinsurance contract? Group the answer by the perils being insured.

The output should be something like:

            Loss
Peril
Earthquake  3500
Hurricane   3000
